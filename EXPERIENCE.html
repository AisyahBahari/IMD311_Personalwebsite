		<p style="text-align: justify;">In this era where the economy is so bad due to a pandemic that shocked all the people and has also caused the people's finances to be bad, business is a way for the people to earn their living and also take care of the family finances. So that, I choose to keep run my business which is Henna Art Services. This service is a service that need to be provide from house to house of any customers. Plus, for me, this service is quite unique and limited because not everyone is talented and can do this kind of job. Furthermore, the income that can be earned from this business and services are also very rewarding and satisfying because the market prices for each art are quite high among professional Henna Artists. Apart from that, this activity or task also gave me a lot of experience as a Henna Artist who just new and wanted to tame myself in this Hennaâ€™s field.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Other than that, among the other experiences that I have got was I had the opportunity to get acquainted with many more strangers who were become my customers which are not from my closest connections. There are also many various types of temperaments I have encountered and faced myself as a Henna Artist. Even that, I also always get good feedback from my customers and they are all very satisfied with my carving and henna results even though I am not a professional henna artist. With this, it to some advance to give me the motivation to continue working in this field and continue to make it a permanent career for me in the future.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Me and my customers</b></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, I also feel very satisfied when all of my customers give and share positive feedbacks. It also gave me the motivation to keep fighting in this field and work. In addition, with this task which aims to expose students to the world of business, it helps me a lot to gain various knowledge in business and I also have the opportunity to learn many tactics and ways to succeed in the business. Among the things that I have learned is that as an entrepreneur, we should always have the passion and mission in business to always achieve the success that every entrepreneur should have and desire in ourselves.</p>
           
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Next, among the benefits that I can learn from my experience is that I get a lot of income and it is very worthwhile for me who is a student. Furthermore, this can also help me to provide pocket money to spend either related to needs or wants which can also be called as self-reward. In addition, this service also does not require a lot of energy like other services. And then, I also have experience doing this work in pairs with my partner who is also a professional Henna Artist. It also means a lot to me to find new experiences and knowledge in the world of henna. With that said, I am very interested in the work I am doing and of course I will continue it as a permanent career in the future after I finish my diploma years.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, previously I was only known among close connections such as friends, relatives and neighbours. Then, through my closest regular customers, the service and business become more growing when they recommend my contact to their friends and other connections who may want to hold an event such as an engagement or wedding. So that, I can also take this opportunity to be better known to many and also have regular customers. Most of my clients that I accept their offers to have my services are only people who are close to my area. At the same time, I also use social media sites to promote about the services I provide to the public. I also put my WhatsApp number in the Instagram page to make it easier for anyone who wants to book for their event.</p>

        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
        	Next, about the supplier for the henna that I use for my customers, she is an acquaintance of mine from the social media Instagram. I will get henna stock from her who is also a Henna Artist and she is quite professional with skills in this field for a long time. I also have learned and gain some knowledges about henna from the videos that she has shared in her social media Instagram. Other than that, I also learned about tips related to henna. Plus, this service will definitely involve my movement from house to house of my customers. And they also usually having me for the service at night. This is because my customers are made up of brides and they need my services to have a henna night with their family members. However, there are also customers who come to walk in to my house to wear henna. So that, I really hope that I will be able to grow further one day and will be a professional and successful Henna Artist.
